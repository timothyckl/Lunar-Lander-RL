    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we have implemented three different reinforcement learning algorithms and have found the DQN agent to be the best out of three due to the higher aveerage rewards received after 500 episodes and also that it takes more steps in order to safely land itself on the landing pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a noisy environment, we have found that on-policy methods like SARSA perform much better although never reaching a solution. However, it remains to be seen if longer training episodes will see the algorithm converge to an optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given more time, we would like to try more methods to better improve or speed up converge of each algorithm such as:\n",

    "- Prioritized Experience Replay\n",
    "- Increased Memory Capacity\n",
    "- Adjust Training Episodes\n",
    "- Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
